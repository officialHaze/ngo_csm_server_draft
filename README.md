# Steps to run server in dev mode

1. Clone the repo to you local system.
2. run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
3. Create a new JSON file inside the `data` directory and name it UploadData.json. (Since no DB is implemented yet, in dev mode the data will be stored in this json file)
4. Open the newly created JSON file, add an empty array `[]` then save the file.
5. run `npm run dev` to run the server in development mode.

# Steps to run server in prod mode

Production steps will be updated later.
